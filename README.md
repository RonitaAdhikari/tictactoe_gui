# Tic Tac Toe Game

## Introduction
This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game created using Java Swing. It allows two players to take turns and compete against each other in a 3x3 grid. The objective of the game is to align three of your symbols (either "X" or "O") in a row, column, or diagonal to win the game. If no player achieves this, the game ends in a draw.

## Features
- User-friendly graphical interface.
- Two players can play, taking turns to place their symbols on the board.
- The game automatically detects when a player wins or when it's a draw.


## How to Play
1. Run the TicTacToe.java file to start the game.
2. The game window will open, displaying the empty 3x3 grid.
3. The starting symbol will be chosen at random(somtimes "X" , sometimes "O").
4. Players take turns clicking on an empty cell in the grid to place their symbol.
5. The game ends when one player gets three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal, and that player wins.
6. If the grid is filled, and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.
